# Vapor-Bones

Some bones utility for Vapor projects:

* `murray bone new emptycontroller {{name you want}}` => creates a new Empty controller and saves it inside `Sources/App/Controllers`
* `murray bone new model {{name you want}}` => creates a new model with basic configuration and a related controller with all CRUD methods (`Post, get all, get single, update, delete `..).
